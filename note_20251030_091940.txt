After a decade of switching between iOS and Android, I've uncovered what truly matters when choosing your next smartphone in 2025. This comparison explores the essential differences that impact your daily experience, from security features to AI capabilities. I reveal which platform excels in what areas, the unexpected advantages each offers, and why certain features might be deal-breakers depending on your needs. Whether you're team Apple or team Android, this breakdown goes beyond specs to show how your choice affects everything from messaging to productivity. Plus, I share my personal verdict after years of using both platforms.

2. The best Android phones 2025: top Google-powered phones
   A titanium design, a new 50MP ultra-wide camera, rounded corners and a whole lot of AI make the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra one of the very best Android phones money can buy right now. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is the best premium Android phone, with great features stolen from the S25 Ultra, and nothing extraneous. Ultimately, if you want excellent value, a great camera (with standout macro), useful AI, and lengthy software support, and you can accept owning what might be the least visually appealing Pixel design to date, the Pixel 9a stands out as the best budget choice for Android phones.

Reviewing the best mid-range Android phones in late 2025, offering the greatest camera tech, impressive gaming performance and top battery life. If you can't afford a flagship, no worries - a tighter budget can still bag you mid-range smartphones like the Pixel 9a, Xiaomi 15T, Poco F7, OnePlus Nord 5 and Vivo V60. Check out my full reviews of each on Tech Spurt - I've tested them all as my full-time mobile.

Also, if you're after an even cheaper budget smartphone, check out my reviews and round-ups of the top options under ¬£300.

Manufacturers like Nothing, Samsung, Xiaomi and Google all offer a selection of flagship alternative phones at a mid-range price. The Pixel 9a is still one of the best for camera fans, although the likes of the Xiaomi 15T aren't far behind at all. And the Nothing Phone 3a and Pro are still two of my favourites, offering solid value for money (plus flashy design).

Meanwhile Samsung fans will enjoy the Galaxy A56, despite its limited performance. Xiaomi also offers the Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus 5G, a fantastic mid-range phone for 2025, boasting impressive specs for a budget-friendly price. Or if your budget is smaller, try the Poco X7 or F7, or the regular Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G.

I've also reviewed the OnePlus Nord 5, which is a downgrade in some respects vs the Nord 4, but still a cracker in many respects. Plus, Motorola also offers its own excellent Edge handsets for a price that won't absolutely slay your savings, including the snazzy Moto Edge 60 Fusion.

Let us know your favourite mid-range smartphones below!
